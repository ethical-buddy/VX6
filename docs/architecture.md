# VX6 Architecture

VX6 is a small stack with a few clear layers.

## 1. Identity

Every node has:

- one Ed25519 identity keypair
- one stable VX6 node ID derived from that key

This identity signs:

- endpoint records
- service records
- DHT envelopes and catalogs

## 2. Node Runtime

`vx6 node` is the runtime process.

It listens for:

- discovery traffic
- DHT requests
- direct service sessions
- relay extension traffic
- hidden-service control and rendezvous traffic
- file transfers

## 3. Service Model

VX6 is built around localhost-to-localhost service access.

That means:

- the owner keeps the real app on `127.0.0.1`
- the client uses a local forwarder on its own machine
- VX6 carries the stream between the two nodes

The app itself does not need to become directly public.

## 4. Discovery

VX6 has two discovery layers:

- registry sync between known peers
- DHT lookups for public, private, and hidden records

The local registry is a working cache.
The DHT is the distributed lookup path.

## 5. DHT

The DHT stores a bounded distributed set of signed records.

Main record families:

- `node/name/...`
- `node/id/...`
- `service/...`
- `private-catalog/...`
- `hidden-desc/v1/...`

Important point:

- not every node stores every record
- each record is stored only on a small responsible set of nodes

## 6. Encryption

VX6 uses two different protection layers:

- secure session encryption between nodes
- layered relay protection for hidden-service paths

Hidden services also use:

- encrypted hidden descriptors
- blinded rotating lookup keys
- invite secrets

## 7. Hidden Services

Hidden services use:

- intro nodes
- guard nodes
- rendezvous nodes
- encrypted and blinded descriptor lookup
- onion-style relay circuits

Current result:

- much stronger privacy than plain alias lookup
- not a full Tor replacement

## 8. Transport

Current transport is TCP only.

The code keeps a transport abstraction so QUIC can be added later, but this build does not use QUIC.

## 9. Runtime Control

VX6 exposes a local runtime control channel for:

- live status
- reload requests
- DHT publish health

This is the shared control model for Linux, Windows, and macOS going forward.
